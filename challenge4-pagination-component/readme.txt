The challenge is to make a pagination component (non-functional):
1. Circular buttons with left and right arrows
2. Link numbers 1-6, ..., 23
3. Buttons and links are horizontally layed out and are center aligned vertically
4. Buttons and links invert colors (green-white to white-green) when hovering
5. Hardcode the 5th page link to be "selected"


Notes:
* To make a circle with radius, first explicitly set height/width the same value
* a: link, visited and a:hover a:active
* "margin 0 auto" only works if the element has a width
